First project of winter 2018 batch. Graphic proposal to follow on [Moqups.com](https://app.moqups.com/Jana-V/0umitZwyaA/view/page/aa9df7b72)

We started with empty HTML5 structure (created by wonderfull Emmet feature `html:5` + `Tab`). We pasted in all texts from our mock-up.

In next step we marked-up the text in HTML tags to give it a structure. We added headings (in correct hierarchy), paragraphs, links and unordered lists. We skipped the form for now.

Then we split the file into sections (based on the mock-up and content logic). (Note, that plain HTML (without any effort from our side) is fully responsive = it adapts to all window/screen widths.)

After the mark-up had been finished we linked empty CSS stylesheet and started styling. First we added basic styles for typography and colours. Colours we chose from mock-up.

Then the we went on with individual sections: navigation, about me, promo (4 boxes at the top). Layout we created using flexbox.
